### Application Use

This app is an exercise in learning to develop applications using React. The application is a basic one page app, with a simple interface. It is basically a memory game where the goal is to click on each image only once, but every time you click, the images are shuffled on the page. It keeps track of your score, and notifies you when you are right, or wrong. 

### Tech Used

* React.js
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* Fontawesome.com
* Javascript
* Netlify
* CSS
* Imgur

### Details of Application & Challenges

The app is very simple, and exists in a single page format. It is set up with several Components and builds together in the main game.js app. When you click on any of the images, it tallies your score, updates the message, and waits for the next click. 

The biggest challenges in this exercise wasn't the logic, as much as it was figuring out how React.js works and how to build it out. The concept of props and states are the main issues, and they are relatively difficult to pass about the app. It was especially hard for me to envision breaking apart such a small app.
